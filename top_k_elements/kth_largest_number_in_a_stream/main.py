  Design a class to efficiently find the Kth largest element in a stream of numbers.
  The class should have the following two things:
  The constructor of the class should accept an integer array
  containing initial numbers from the stream and an integer â€˜Kâ€™.
  The class should expose a function add(int num)
  which will store the given number and return the Kth largest number.
